# Dependency-Visualizer
Visualize RequireJS dependencies, or something.

## Explanatory Things
- Arrows showing dependencies go from the dependent to the dependee/dependency.

### Controls
- Click and drag nodes to move them around
- Hover over nodes to see their file path
- Double click a node to move it to the center and show its dependencies
- Type and wait in the white box at the bottom of the page to search for nodes.
- If you try a super general search like 's', you're gonna have a bad time.
